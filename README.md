# db-console-app
An old test for applying to a coder job...
The idea of using arguments wasn't mine, it was required so.

Supposed to be used from a terminal with some initialization arguments:
1) 1 - initializes a new local database file;
2) 2 lastname firstname middlename birthdate gender - adds a new record to the database with provided params;
3) 3 - outputs all unique sets of records (users) ordered by last name;
4) 4 - automaticly populates database with one million records containing random params and adding 100 more records where firstname is letter 'f';
5) 5 - selects unique records with 'Male' gender and the lastname starting from letter 'f' and outputs time taken in seconds;
